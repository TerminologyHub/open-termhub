=============
Wci Demo
=============

Initial project to play around with terminology data models, and a small amount of actual data.

Note: full use of this depends on a local build also of 
      https://github.com/WestCoastInformatics/UMLS-Terminology-Server.git (1.5.1-SNAPSHOT)

Note: to fully configure this project "Node.js" needs to be installed
      and the node.exec parameter in the src/resources/config.properties
      must be set to it.  It is also important to get relevant node libraries
      by using "npm install blue-button"
